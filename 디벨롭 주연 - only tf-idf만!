Enjoy the uplifting power of long lasting scents as they subtly diffuse throughout the day, amplified by the natural movement of the hair. Each hair perfume combines one of BYREDO's signature scents with a unique silicone and polymer formula to create a light, invisible veil designed to leave the hair nourished and luminous whilst divinely scented.\\rBal d'Afrique is inspired by Paris in the late 1920's, when the city was infatuated with an idiosyncratic and fantastical vision of African culture, music and dance. A vivacious blast of sunny citrus with just a pinch of spicy marigold makes a suitably dramatic entrance, leading to a brew of green bucchu, sheer and aqueous cyclamen and sweet violet. At center stage is the ever-bewitching vetiver, earthy and spicy, and smoothed with sweet amber and warm musk until it becomes velvety and almost edible. An extra soup\\u00c3\\u00a7on of growl is provided by cedar wood, but the overall effect is less voracious man-eating tiger and more of a mischievous tiger cub \\u0096 sweet and adorable, but it still has claws. Bal d'Afrique is warm and embracing with a purring, cozy quality that has us at its mercy. Be careful, this one is addictive.\",\n          \" As with all great stories, Tango immediately sets the stage: bergamot, black pepper and cardamom whisk us away to a sultry summer night in the Canary Islands, a party already in full swing. The music swells louder as you tip back another glass of local honey rum, heady, sweet and inebriating. You turn your head to catch the warm evening breeze, which carries the scent of night blooming jasmine mingled with the salty sweat of the revelers, and you catch the eye of a beautiful stranger. Another deep gulp of the rum, cool vanilla standing out against the rich, warm amber. You stand and offer your hand- you're not always this brave, but tonight, the rum and the rhythm will not be denied. And just as she smiles and rises to meet you, the music reaches crescendo, and the air seems to get even hotter. \\rTango is a deep amber fragrance, warm and sensual, spicy and indulgent, and more than a little bit wild. The perfect scent for your next island-hopping nighttime adventure- or to add a little heat to any night at all.\",\n          \" Rome- the eternal city, a bustling modern metropolis with thousands of years of history beating in its heart and etched into its streets. Zefiro pays homage to Rome's baroque alchemy, a fragrance with both the instant appeal and the grand mystery of such a prestigious capital, suggestive and elusive, vibrant and unknowable. \\rZefiro opens with the lavish giddiness of il dolce far niente, a long weekend of fine wine and rich fruits. Cardamom and cinnamon evoke both mouthwatering cuisine and the well-spiced bustle of Rome's never-ending crowds, while iris and carnation represent beauty in all forms, from the perpetual spring season to the fashionable beauties in every square and nightclub. But Rome is also a city of history, and as Zefiro dries down, a rich amber and smoky incense remind us that around every corner is another masterpiece-stuffed museum, extravagant palazzo, or Imperial stronghold. And yet, a sweet, pervasive honey holds the earlier notes in place as well- after all, Rome isn't a city that changes, but a city where ancient and modern take root together in a hypnotic whirl.\"\n

This is a fragrance built on white floral accords and relates to the white Siberian Rose.\\rThe fragrance opens with fruity spicy top note composed of cinnamon, juniper, pear and pink pepper. The floral journey begins with a white heart note; tuberose, white rose and ylang-ylang. A rich touch of leather which evokes memories of the Siberian wilderness making this fragrance so natural and sensual. Siberian Rose has great longevity from its harmonious base notes of patchouli, amber and moss.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n
